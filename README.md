## Overview
This is an implementation of a modified LLL algorithm in `SageMath` and `Python` and a random sampling algorithm in `SageMath`.

## Description
- Modified_LLL is an modification of the LLL reduction program, which can take a linearly dependent vector as input. 

- RandomSampling is a program that uniformly randomly sample the lattice vectors until the norm is shorter than the standard value.

## Requirement
- SageMath version 9.5
