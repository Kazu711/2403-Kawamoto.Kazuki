## Overview
This is an implementation of the modified LLL algorithm(MLLL) and random sampling algorithm(SA) in `SageMath`.

## Description
MLLL is an modification of the LLL reduction program, which can take a linearly dependent vector as input. 

SA is a program that uniformly randomly sample the lattice vectors until the norm is shorter than the standard value.

## Requirement
- SageMath version 9.5
